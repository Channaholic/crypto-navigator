The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply.

It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.',\n",

'리플 프로토콜'이란 분산원장을 기반으로 한 ‘실시간 총액결제 시스템(RTS)’으로 국제결제시스템망(SWIFT)을 대체할 새로운 대안으로 주목받고 있습니다.\\r\\n\\r\\n송금 시스템에 가까운 특성이 있어 일반적인 가상화폐와는 그 구조가 다릅니다. 사용하는 합의 프로토콜도 독자적일 뿐만 아니라, 다른 코인들과 다르게 현실적으로 주도권의 집중화가 있기 때문입니다. 따라서 리플의 시스템은 한정된 참여자만 분산 네트워크를 구성한다는 의미에서 프라이빗 블록체인(private blockchain)이라고 불리기도 합니다. \\r\\n\\r\\n리플사는 총량의 62%의 코인을 보유하고 있으며, 사업 개발 단계에 따라 전략적으로 시장에 유통하고 있습니다. 리플사는 그들이 전체 유통의 반수 이상으로 보유하고 있는 코인을 악용할 우려를 잠재우기 위해 암호화를 통해 보호된 조건부 날인 계정(escrow)에 리플을 넣어둔다고 합니다.\\r\\n\\r\\n코인 특징\\r\\n1. 현재 주로 은행 간 이체서비스에 집중하여 진행 중이며, 리플 네트워크에는 미쓰비시 도쿄UFJ 은행, 스웨덴 SEB, 중동의 아부다비 국립은행과 인도 Axis 은행을 비롯한 세계 주요 금융권 75개가 참여하고 있습니다. 매년 빠른 속도로 확장하고 있으며, 최근 이들의 적극적인 참여로 상호 송금 거래 규모는 하루 7700만 달러를 넘어섰습니다.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. 리플은 연결 통화(bridge currency)로 역할 하므로 기존 통화시장과 달리 수요가 적은 희귀통화를 거래하기 쉽습니다. 복잡한 거래 과정이 불필요하고, 추가적인 비용도 지출되지 않기 때문입니다. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. 거래마다 0.0004달러의 수수료를 지급합니다. 이는 네트워크 스팸 공격을 막기 위한 것이며, 매우 적은 액수이므로 기존의 결제시스템보다 비교우위에 있습니다. 또한, 이 수수료는 영원히 소멸하게 되는데, 이는 시간이 지날수록 토큰의 가치가 조금씩 높아짐을 의미합니다. \\r\\n\\r\\n4. 인플레이션이 없습니다. 시간이 지날수록 화폐 총량이 늘어나는 대부분 가상화폐와 달리, 리플은 초기에 총 1천억 개 발행되었고 이제 더 추가로 생성되지 않기 때문입니다.\\r\\n\\r\\n핵심 가치\\r\\n(키워드: 환전/송금 거래에 P2P 네트워크의 적용)\\r\\n\\r\\nP2P 네트워크는 서로 모르는 사람 혹은 은행 간의 외환 거래를 중개하는 다리를 만들어 줍니다. 따라서 SWIFT와 같은 중개기관이 필요하지 않아 저렴한 비용으로 신속한 국제 결제 서비스를 가능하게 합니다.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. 결제 비용 감소: 중개기관을 거치지 않으므로 수수료를 절약 가능합니다. 특히 환전 시 달러 거래와 달리 은행 계좌를 요구하지 않기 때문에 서비스 수수료나 추가 운용 비용이 발생하지 않습니다. 따라서 리플은 기존 환율보다 훨씬 더 경쟁력 있는 외환 가격을 제공합니다. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. 실시간 결제: 전 세계 어디든 거래당 4초가 걸리며 즉각적인 정산이 가능합니다.

       "  'description': {'en': 'Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">smart contract platform</a> which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \\r\\n\\r\\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnological Innovation\\r\\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake algorithm</a>. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nCardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nConceptual Innovation\\r\\n\\r\\ni. Privacy and regulation\\r\\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. Governance\\r\\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum\\'s case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\niii. Funding\\r\\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\\r\\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\\r\\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/\">IOHK</a> specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe <a href=\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\">Cardano Foundation</a>\\r\\nThe Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications\\r\\n2. Be a community hub offering authoritative, timely information about the technology and Cardano’s wide-ranging potential\\r\\n3. Liaise and influence government and regulatory bodies, form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open source projects and aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for its long term success and critical in adoption and government engagement\\r\\n\\r\\nAreas of Focus:\\r\\n1. Cardano Protocol - We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.\\r\\n2. Cardano community - We support, grow and help educate the Cardano blockchain community.\\r\\n3. Cardano ecosystem - We work to expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem. This includes promoting Cardano as a platform for commercial entities and serving as an objective organization for enterprises interested in joining Cardano.\\r\\n4.

Privacy and regulation\\r\\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\\r\\n\\r\\nii. Governance\\r\\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum\\'s case already causing a split.

Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\\r\\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada.
